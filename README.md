# Face-Recognition-From-A-Group-Photo
This repo demonstrates to find the known faces in a photo having a group of people

To run the program, in terminal type python main.py(first go to the folder where the main.py file for this project is stored)

The photos of each individual should be stored in a folder [Images] (photo_1, photo_2 etc). Test images are stored in testimage folder.

I have used the dlib library to detect the faces first. Then using the face_recognition module helps in recognition of the faces. 
I have used face_recognition as it can be used to identify images with the help of only a single image!
